## Introduction

Spam emails, also known as junk email, are unwanted messages sent to a large number of recipients. This project aims to develop a machine learning-based model to detect and classify these emails accurately. We used XGBoost and Logistic Regression, optimized through GridSearchCV, to achieve high performance.

## Features

- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- Feature Extraction: Using CountVectorizer to convert text data into numerical features.
- Model Training: Training XGBoost and Logistic Regression models.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Using GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters.
- Web Application: Implementing a real-time email classification app using Django.
